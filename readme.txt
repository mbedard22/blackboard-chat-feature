Disclaimer, our implemention is not perfect because of the number of different resources that get compiled into one and the timeframe.
We tested the program to behave properly under expected input. We implemented some checks to prevent unauthorized behavior except there are still 
somethings that can cause unexpected behavior in the program. So just make sure you read the flow and make sure you are inputting the expected input.
